# WearOS SMS

## About The App
[WearOS SMS On The Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nick.mowen.wearossms) was removed due to Google SMS Permission Policy. As such, the app has been open-sourced and moved here so that anyone can download the app.

WearOS SMS is the solution to all your SMS problems! If you find yourself with a phone app that you love, but wish its Wear app was better, this is the answer!

WearOS SMS allows you to read your inbox, messages, and pictures all on your wrist, and it doesn't even need to be the default app! Just download the phone app and accept the permissions and you will be on your way!

Note: It is necessary to install the companion phone app (for the ability to load SMS messages) as well as the WearOS app itself

Enjoy features like:
+ App theming including dark mode and colors
+ Choose the amount of messages to get on the watch
+ Create new conversations or reply to current ones all from your watch
+ View picture messages right on the watch

## Free For Everyone
As apart of open sourcing this app, I have removed the pay walls for all features and the app is completely free. 

However, if you would like to contribute to development / support the cause of this app, you can [paypal me here](https://paypal.me/nickmowen). Thank you, I really appreciate it!
